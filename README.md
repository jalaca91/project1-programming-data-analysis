# project_1-programming-data-analysis
This repository is part of the module of the same name of the HDip in Data Analysis of ATU Galway and contains the first project.  

## Content
The repository consists of a git.ignore file, a readme and a jupyter notebook file with the code and explanation of the project.  
This readme lists the contents of the notebook file, the procedures it contains and a brief description of the file.    
  
## Problem statement
Specifically, this project contains the following:
1. A real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which at least one hundred data points can be collected, with at least four different variables.
2. Investigating the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships to each other and to each other.
3. Synthesize/simulate a data set as close as possible to its properties.

## Description of the notebook

The first part of the notebook indicates an introduction, where the technologies used to elaborate the notebook are presented, the chosen theme around which the analysis and related
information revolves, which variables and why they are representative for the work, what type of distribution they have and how they are related to each other, and based on that, 
the database for the chosen theme will be created.  

The references used for the research are numbered at the end of the notebook.
