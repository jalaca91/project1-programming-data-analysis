    "## Theme of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "For the elaboration of the project I have chosen as the main topic walking as a physical activity and its relation with health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walking is a basic and inherent human activity; it was our main transportation mechanism. We did it out of necessity, not by will, since in ancient times our ancestors were hunter-gatherer societies.\n",
    "Nowadays we can get an idea of this lifestyle based on current primitive societies, such as the Hazda[1] who underwent a study[2] to observe how many daily steps they took, with a daily estimate of 9 km for women and 15 km for men.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of industrialization, with the invention of cars, office jobs and elevators all this changed. We humans became more sedentary due to our changing lifestyles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used to spend a large part of the day on the move and now through our mobile phone we can order food without any dose of movement. \n",
    "This lack of movement, along with the intake of industrial and processed foods and bad habits, has had a negative impact on health.  \n",
    "According to the following study[3] from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), nearly 1 in 3 adults (30.7%) are overweight and more than 2 in 5 adults (42.4%) are obese in the United States.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This raises awareness of the need to include physical activity in our lives, as there are many known benefits of walking:\n",
    "1. It is one of the easiest, most accessible and low-impact physical activities and does not require a large investment of money, apart from comfortable clothes and shoes.  \n",
    "2. It is good for the heart, as it lowers blood pressure.[4] \n",
    "3. Despite being a low intensity activity, it is good for weight loss. \n",
    "4. It is good for managing stress and improving creativity.[5] \n",
    "\n",
    "The best known and most famous recommendation is to take 10,000 steps, originated in the 1960s by a pedometer called manpo-kei.\n",
    "However, there are numerous studies that indicate that with fewer steps, multiple benefits are already achieved, as explained in a meta-analysis presented by Lancet[6].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the information presented and the research, for the creation of the database, I will use the following variables:\n",
    "1. Age\n",
    "2. Sex\n",
    "3. Number of daily steps\n",
    "4. Occupation (manual or non-manual work)\n",
    "5. Smoker (no or yes)\n",
    "6. BMI \n",
    "\n",
    "The explanation of each variable can be found in the following section."
